              <h2 class="mb-4" style="color: #ff4400">what is an algorithm?</h2>
              <p>
                An algorithm is a series of logical steps that are
                systematically designed to solve a problem or achieve a specific
                goal. In the world of programming and computer science, an
                algorithm serves as a guide or instruction that will be followed
                by a program to process data and produce the desired output. In
                other words, an algorithm is the core of problem-solving logic
                that can be applied in various fields, both in technology,
                business, and everyday life. Understanding what an algorithm is
                will help us to more easily understand specific concepts such as
                the Apriori algorithm, which is one of the algorithms used to
                find patterns or relationships in large data sets.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Finiteness:</strong> The algorithm must have a finite
                  number of steps and must stop after a certain number of steps.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Definiteness:</strong> Each step must be clear,
                  unambiguous, and understandable by anyone who reads the
                  algorithm.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Input:</strong> The algorithm accepts input data or
                  initial values.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Output:</strong> The algorithm produces an output that
                  is relevant to the goal it seeks to achieve.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Effectiveness:</strong> All steps must be practically
                  executable within reasonable time and resource constraints.

                <p>
                  Finiteness: The algorithm must have a finite number of steps
                  and must stop after a certain number of steps.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Definiteness: Each step in the algorithm must be clear and
                  unambiguous. Each instruction must be understandable to anyone
                  who reads the algorithm.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Input: The algorithm receives external input (from the user or
                  other systems) that is used in the calculation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Output: The algorithm produces output that is in accordance
                  with the goal it wants to achieve. This output can be a value,
                  status, or other useful information.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Efficiency: The algorithm must be able to solve the problem
                  with the minimum amount of time and resources, especially in
                  terms of speed (computation time) and memory usage.

                The Importance of Algorithms in Programming
              </h2>
              <p>
                Algorithms are the core of programming as they help solve
                problems efficiently and systematically. With algorithms,
                programmers can create solutions that save time and resources.
                Additionally, algorithms simplify the development of programs
                that can be used by many people and adapted for various needs.
                Without algorithms, the programming process would become
                disorganized and less optimal.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Efficiency:</strong> Algorithms optimize the use of
                  resources like time and memory, ensuring that programs run
                  smoothly and quickly.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Scalability:</strong> Well-designed algorithms can
                  handle growing data and user demands without significant
                  performance degradation.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Reusability:</strong> Algorithms can be adapted and
                  reused across various programs and projects, saving time in
                  development.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Problem-Solving:</strong> Algorithms provide a
                  systematic approach to solving complex problems, making them
                  manageable and solvable.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Innovation:</strong> Understanding algorithms enables
                  programmers to develop innovative solutions and contribute to
                  advancements in technology.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                By mastering algorithms, programmers can write code that is not
                only functional but also efficient, scalable, and adaptable to
                future challenges. They are the backbone of technologies we use
                daily, from search engines to recommendation systems.
